# ☕ Java Projects by Joe Habre

Welcome to my collection of Java projects — a showcase of my Computer Science journey at AUB and my passion for building clean, functional, and interactive software.  
These projects explore core programming concepts like **object-oriented design, file handling, GUI development, CLI tools, and problem-solving**.  

Each application is written with **readability, modularity, and future expansion** in mind.
