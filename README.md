# â˜• Java Projects by Joe Habre

Welcome to my curated collection of Java mini-projects â€” a showcase of my journey and passion for writing clean, functional, and interactive software. These projects reinforce core programming concepts like object-oriented design, file handling, GUI development, and user-friendly CLI applications.

Each application is carefully built with readability, modularity, and future expansion in mind.
