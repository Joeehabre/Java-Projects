# ☕ Java Projects by Joe Habre

Welcome to my curated collection of Java mini-projects. This repository showcases my journey in mastering core Java concepts by building functional and interactive terminal and GUI-based applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate real-world problem solving through clean, modular code using object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and basic game logic.

## 🛠️ Projects

### 🔹 [Bank Account System](./bank-account)
A command-line banking simulation where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and access their accounts using unique IDs.  
**Concepts:** Classes, Object-Oriented Programming, Maps, Scanner, Input Validation

### 🔹 [Calculator](./calculator)
A robust terminal calculator that supports basic operations (+, -, *, /) and advanced ones like exponentiation and modulus. It loops until the user quits, and handles errors gracefully.  
**Concepts:** Control Flow, Methods, Loops, Exception Handling

### 🔹 [To-Do List](./todo-list)
An interactive CLI to-do list manager where users can add and remove tasks. All tasks are stored in a local file (`tasks.txt`) so they persist between runs.  
**Concepts:** File I/O, ArrayLists, Scanner Input, Input Validation

### 🔹 [Snake Game](./snake-game)
A complete version of the classic Snake game built with Java Swing. Features include score tracking, increasing speed, keyboard controls, game over screen, and restart functionality.  
**Concepts:** Java GUI (Swing), Timer, Key Events, Game Loop Logic
