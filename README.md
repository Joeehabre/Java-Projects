# ☕ Java Projects by Joe Habre

Welcome to my collection of Java mini-projects — a showcase of my growth as a developer and my passion for building clean, functional, and interactive software using Java. Each project here is designed to reinforce core programming concepts like object-oriented design, file handling, GUI development, and more.

These applications range from practical tools to classic games, all written with readability, modularity, and future improvement in mind.
