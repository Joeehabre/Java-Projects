# ☕ Java Projects

A growing collection of beginner to intermediate-level Java projects I’ve built to sharpen my understanding of core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, and problem solving.

This repo is a practical sandbox of CLI-based applications designed to reinforce my learning and provide reusable code for common programming tasks.
